###Concept
- **Purpose**: A web app for designing custom Gridfinity configurations (baseplates and bins) on a flexible canvas, with color customization and STL generation for the Bambu A1 Mini.
- **Core Functionality**:
  - Drag-and-drop canvas for placing Gridfinity baseplates and bins, enforcing 42mm grid rules.
  - Color customization (Blue, Red, Black, Grey, White) for visual distinction in the UI.
  - Handle large configurations by splitting into multiple print plates (each ≤ 180x180mm) during STL generation.
  - Pop-up tips, template options, and “popular setups” to guide beginners.
  - Checkout with itemized order and confirmation email with design preview.
  - Owner-specific insights (print time, filament usage) for internal use.
- **User Workflow**:
  1. User accesses the canvas, optionally starts with a template or popular setup.
  2. They build a configuration using predefined baseplates and bins, with pop-up tips.
  3. Save (if logged in) or proceed to checkout.
  4. Review order, pay, receive confirmation email with preview; backend generates STLs for multiple print plates.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **Frontend**: Next.js for UI, Three.js for 3D previews.
  - **Backend**: STL generation on AWS (details TBD), splitting large configurations into print plates.
- **Scope**: Gridfinity only, Bambu A1 Mini focus, monetized via component and shipping charges.
A web application designed to simplify the creation of custom Gridfinity storage configurations for 3D printing on the Bambu A1 Mini. Users can design modular grid-based layouts with baseplates and bins, customize colors, and generate print-ready STL files for purchase, targeting beginners in the maker community.

### Updated UI Plan
The UI will prioritize simplicity, guided onboarding, and visual clarity, tailored to the Gridfinity components from the MakerWorld link (). I’ve incorporated your preferences for colors, bin types, onboarding, and checkout details.[](https://makerworld.com/en/models/47599-ultimate-gridfinity-bins-collection-parametric)

#### 1. Landing Page
- **Purpose**: Introduce the app and guide users to the canvas.
- **Elements**:
  - Header: “Create Your Custom Gridfinity Storage!”
  - Hero image: Example Gridfinity setup (e.g., 4x4 baseplate with colorful bins).
  - Buttons: “Start Designing” (links to canvas), “Popular Setups” (showcases templates).
  - Collapsible section: “What is Gridfinity?” with a brief explainer and link to MakerWorld.
  - Login/signup link (top-right) for saving designs.
- **Design Notes**:
  - Mobile-responsive, with a clean, maker-friendly aesthetic (e.g., bold fonts, grid motifs).
  - Highlight ease of use: “No 3D modeling skills needed!”

#### 2. Canvas Interface
- **Purpose**: Enable users to build Gridfinity configurations with ease.
- **Layout**:
  - **Main Canvas (Center)**:
    - Flexible 2D grid (42mm units), no fixed size, with a faint outline of the A1 Mini’s 180x180mm bed for reference.
    - Drag-and-drop baseplates and bins, snapping to grid.
    - Visual feedback: Green outline for valid placements, red for overlaps or invalid positions.
    - Warning pop-up if configuration exceeds 180x180mm: “Your design will be split into multiple prints.”
  - **Toolbar (Left Sidebar)**:
    - **Baseplates** (from MakerWorld link):
      - 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 (outer dimensions: 42mm, 84mm, 126mm, 168mm).
    - **Bins** (from MakerWorld link, 1x1 to 6x6, heights 0 to 12 units):
      - MVP selection: 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 2x2, 2x3, 2x4, 3x3, 3x4, 4x4.
      - Heights: 2u (17.55mm), 4u (31.55mm), 6u (45.55mm), 8u (59.55mm) for simplicity.
      - No magnet/screw holes (per MakerWorld default, suitable for drawers/non-moving setups).
    - **Color Picker**: Blue, Red, Black, Grey, White (applies visually to grids/bins).
    - Tools: Undo, Redo, Reset Canvas.
  - **Preview Panel (Right Sidebar)**:
    - Toggle 2D/3D view (Three.js for lightweight 3D render).
    - Display dimensions (e.g., “Total: 168x126mm”) and print plate count (e.g., “Requires 2 plates”).
    - Warning if design is too large: “Exceeds A1 Mini bed, will split into X plates.”
  - **Top Bar**:
    - Save Design (requires login).
    - “Proceed to Checkout” button.
    - User profile/logout.
- **Onboarding Features**:
  - **Pop-up Tips**: On first load:
    - “Drag a baseplate to start!” (points to toolbar).
    - “Add bins to organize your setup!” (highlights bin section).
    - “Choose colors to customize!” (shows color picker).
  - **Templates/Popular Setups** (accessible via button):
    - Examples: “Starter Kit” (2x2 baseplate, 4x 1x1 bins), “Tool Organizer” (4x4 baseplate, 2x 2x2, 4x 1x2 bins).
    - Load template directly onto canvas.
- **Design Notes**:
  - Simple, touch-friendly drag-and-drop for mobile (collapse sidebars into hamburger menu).
  - Limit bin heights to 2u, 4u, 6u, 8u for MVP to reduce complexity (full range up to 12u in future iterations).
  - Colors are visual only (no impact on STL unless AMS multi-material is added later).

#### 3. Checkout Page
- **Purpose**: Finalize the order and trigger STL generation.
- **Elements**:
  - **Order Summary**:
    - Itemized list (e.g., “1x 4x4 baseplate, 2x 1x1 bins (6u), 1x 2x2 bin (4u)”).
    - Total cost (components + shipping, TBD).
  - **Design Preview**: 3D render of the configuration (using Three.js).
  - **Input Fields**: Shipping address, payment details.
  - **Confirm Order** button: Triggers STL generation (split into plates) and sends confirmation email.
  - **Confirmation Email**:
    - Includes 2D/3D preview image of the design.
    - Lists ordered components and estimated delivery.
- **Owner Insights** (Internal Dashboard, not user-facing):
  - Accessible via admin login.
  - Shows print time and filament usage estimates per order (e.g., “4x4 baseplate: ~2h, 50g PLA”).
  - Aggregated data: Total orders, popular bin sizes, etc.
- **Design Notes**:
  - Clear, step-by-step layout to avoid confusion.
  - Highlight total cost and preview prominently.

#### 4. User Account (Optional for MVP)
- **Purpose**: Save and manage designs.
- **Elements**:
  - List of saved configurations with 2D thumbnails.
  - Edit, delete, or load designs to canvas.
  - Profile: Email, default shipping address.
- **Design Notes**: Defer unless saving is critical for MVP.

### Technical Considerations
- **Next.js**:
  - Structure: Pages (`/`, `/canvas`, `/checkout`), components (`Canvas`, `Toolbar`, `Preview`).
  - Use React state to manage canvas configuration (baseplates, bins, colors).
  - API routes for saving designs and processing checkout (e.g., `/api/save`, `/api/order`).
- **Three.js**:
  - Load pre-generated GLTF models for baseplates (1x1 to 4x4) and bins (1x1 to 4x4, 2u to 8u).
  - Apply color textures dynamically (Blue, Red, Black, Grey, White).
  - Optimize for mobile: Low-poly models, minimal lighting.
- **Gridfinity Rules**:
  - Enforce 42mm grid snapping client-side (e.g., using a coordinate system).
  - Validate placements: No overlaps, bins must fit within baseplate boundaries.
- **Large Configurations**:
  - Client-side: Warn if canvas exceeds 180x180mm, estimate plate count (e.g., a 252x252mm design needs 4 plates).
  - Backend (TBD): Split configuration into plates during STL generation, ensuring each fits the A1 Mini bed.
- **AWS**:
  - Host Next.js app via Amplify or S3 + CloudFront.
  - Use S3 for storing saved designs; Lambda for owner insights (print time, filament estimates).

### Incorporating MakerWorld Link ()[](https://makerworld.com/en/models/47599-ultimate-gridfinity-bins-collection-parametric)
The “Ultimate Gridfinity Bins Collection” provides a comprehensive set of bins (1x1 to 6x6, heights 0 to 12 units, 87.55mm max). For the MVP:
- **Baseplates**: 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 (up to 168x168mm, fits A1 Mini bed).
- **Bins**: 
  - Sizes: 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 2x2, 2x3, 2x4, 3x3, 3x4, 4x4.
  - Heights: 2u (17.55mm), 4u (31.55mm), 6u (45.55mm), 8u (59.55mm).
  - No magnet/screw holes, no labels (per your focus on simplicity).
- **Future Expansion**: Include larger sizes (5x5, 6x6) or additional heights (up to 12u) if scaling to other printers.

### Owner Insights
- **Print Time/Filament Estimates** (admin dashboard):
  - Use average values from Bambu Studio or community data (e.g., 1x1 bin, 6u: ~30min, 15g PLA).
  - Calculate per plate (e.g., “Plate 1: 4x4 baseplate, 2h, 50g; Plate 2: 2x 1x1 bins, 1h, 30g”).
  - Store in AWS (e.g., DynamoDB) for analytics.
- **Implementation**: Defer until after UI, but plan for API endpoint (e.g., `/api/estimate`) to fetch estimates based on configuration.

### Next Steps
1. **Finalize MVP Components**:
   - Confirm bin sizes/heights (e.g., exclude 3x4, 4x4 if too complex for MVP).
   - Define 2-3 template setups (e.g., “Starter Kit”: 2x2 baseplate, 4x 1x1 bins, 6u).
2. **Detailed Wireframe**:
   - Create a Figma mockup or detailed text description of each page (landing, canvas, checkout).
   - Example: Specify exact toolbar layout (e.g., grid icons above bin icons).
3. **Next.js Setup**:
   - Outline project structure (e.g., `pages/canvas.js`, `components/Canvas.js`).
   - Mock canvas logic (e.g., grid snapping, drag-and-drop) using React state.
4. **Three.js Plan**:
   - Source GLTF models for baseplates/bins (e.g., from MakerWorld or generate via OpenSCAD).
   - Test color application (e.g., texture swaps for Blue, Red, etc.).
5. **User Testing**:
   - Define tasks: “Build a 2x2 grid with two 1x1 bins,” “Use a template,” “Check out.”
   - Simulate with a paper prototype or basic HTML mockup.
